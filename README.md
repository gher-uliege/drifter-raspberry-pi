Ths repo containts the software to implement a data-logger in Julia for an ocean surface drifter which also communicates the data over the cell phone network.

## Switch on/off

* Connection via ssh

``` bash
sudo shutdown -h now
```

Wait that green led is off, then disconnect power supply.

## Start-up sequence

Approximate timings:

* 4 min: to boot Rasberry Pi (under-clocked, with only 1 CPUs)
* 30 s: start WaveShare Hat
* 1 min: wait (so that peak power consumption does not coincides with GSM network registration)
* 1 min: register to GSM network and send first SMS
